# Commands Cheat Sheet
1. Sort of hot testing & reloading: `cargo watch -x check`
2. Linting: `cargo clippy`
3. Package auditing: `cargo audit`
4. Formatting: `cargo fmt`
5. Expanding macros: `cargo expand`
   1. For specific files `cargo expand --test health_check`
6. Run the server: `cargo run`
7. Starting a database: `SKIP_DOCKER=true ./scripts/init_db.sh‚Äù`
1. To create & run migrations:
   ```
   sqlx migrate add create_subscriptions_table
   export DATABASE_URL=postgres://app:secret@localhost:5432/newsletters
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

# Personal notes

## 3.3
1. The `Responder` traits main job is just to allow things to be converted into `HttpResponse`
2. All asynchronous programming in Rust is built on the `Futures` trait - particularly, they expose a `poll` method that has to be called for this to make progress
   1. This is why `main` cannot be an async function - who is going to call poll on it?

## 3.4
1. In the previous implementation in 3.3, the `run` method creates the server and calls await on it. The `main` method which calls run has to await in order to unwrap the future (ie. it is a future in a future)
2. The test implementation here gets to just call `tokio::spawn` on the server which spins it up as a background task instead of running the test as a server

## 3.5
1. Port 0 triggers an OS scan for whatever available port

## 3.7
1. actix-web's handlers calls the from_request methods inside the arguments passed before they even get passed to the handler
   1. This allows the handler to deal with strongly typed arguments
   2. The data (ie. FormData) handles the data itself
   3. So, what's happening is when the email or name is missing, FormData wrapped in serde will return 400 without us needing to explicitly handle it in the handler
2. Serde stands for serialisation/deserialisation
3. Misc aside, reminder to self:
   1. `#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]` is saying to implement the serde::Deserialize trait for `FormData`
   2. `impl<T> Serialize for Vec<T>` is an implementation of Serialize for `Vec`, NOT a definition of the trait

# 3.8
1. Personal reflection: API integration tests agnostic to the underlying implementation (ie. instead of querying the database within the test to check for side effects, query a GET endpoint to inspect the data after the fact)
2. `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://app:secret@localhost:5432/newsletter && sqlx migrate run`
